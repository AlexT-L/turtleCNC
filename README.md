# TurtleStitch

TurtleStitch is a visual, blocks-based programming environment for turtle graphics with a focus on 
embroidery file generation. 

The generated patterns can be exported as a embroidery file (currently Melco/EXP and Tajima/DST are supported) or SVG vector graphic

TurtleStitch is based on [Snap<i>!</i> Build Your Own Blocks](http://snap.berkeley.edu) written by Jens Mönig and Brian Harvey.

It uses webgl [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org) as rendering engine for performance as smooth as possible.
