# TurtleCNC

TurtleCNC is based on TurtleStitch, a visual, blocks-based programming environment for turtle graphics with a focus on 
embroidery file generation, which has been modified to generate CNC code.

The generated patterns can be exported as a gcode file.

TurtleCNC and TurtleStitch are based on [Snap<i>!</i> Build Your Own Blocks](http://snap.berkeley.edu) written by Jens Mönig and Brian Harvey.

It uses webgl [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org) as rendering engine for performance as smooth as possible.
